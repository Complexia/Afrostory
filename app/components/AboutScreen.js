                    We are inspired to put a billion books in African households where there were none or few before, and 
                    a small black author focused library in every home. 
                    We are an African business. We are an Ethical business. We are launching our first product that will 
                    change millions of lives, providing a unique set of literature with easy access to African history, 
                    heritage and stories to inspire, educate and entertain us all. This is important now more than ever 
                    with the number of people spending large amounts of time indoors during COVID-19 with little or no 
                    access to literature. Our high volume, low price business model, with capped profits, marketing focus, 
                    and prices that only fall with time, is also a big part of our values and what we believe in.
                    We treat all our staff that helped establish the business (all shareholders) with kindness and respect.
                    ave caps on our profits in order to transition into a non-profit organization as soon as we can.
